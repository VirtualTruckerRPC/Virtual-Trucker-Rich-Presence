## Use in end user environment
* Install Virtual Trucker Rich Presence using a release installation package from [Releases Page](https://github.com/VirtualTruckerRPC/Virtual-Trucker-Rich-Presence/releases) .

Take a look to [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for further details.

## Use in development environment
But here is the most important information:  

REQUIRED PROGRAMS:  
* ETCARS 0.15.386 - https://etcars.jammerxd.com/
* NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/  
* Git - https://git-scm.com

1. Install and download the required programs.   
3. Open cmd/powershell by holding shift while right clicking inside the VTRPC directory.  
4. Install the required node modules by typing "npm i" in PS/CMD.  
5. Start the rich presence by typing "node index.js --dev". (--dev not required but recommended)  
6. Start ETS2/ATS.  
7. Select that and start playing!  

## Prepare for distribution
* Run `npm run compile` .
* Bundled exe will be written in `release` directory.

## Create installation package
* Install InnoSetup 5.6.1 - http://files.jrsoftware.org/is/5/innosetup-5.6.1.exe (YOU WILL NEED INNOSETUP 5!)
* Install Inno Download Plugin - https://bit.ly/2KnepSA
* Open `setup\InnoSetup.iss` with InnoSetup and compile it
* Run `iscc .\setup\InnoSetupScript.iss` (Add to PATH variable env `C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 5`)
* Installation package will be written in `setup\Output\VirtualTruckerRichPresenceSetup.exe`

### Why is there a VBScript in this project?
We need `RunHidden.vbs` to run a packaged node.js app windowless in windows. So, the application is launched from that vbscript.

## Logging
Log files are written in:
* Windows: `%appdata%\VirtualTruckerRichPresence\`
* Linux: `/var/local/VirtualTruckerRichPresence/`
* MacOS: `/home/Library/Preferences/VirtualTruckerRichPresence/`

## Startup parameters
* --dev : enable verbose development logging and dev environment behaviour
* --promods : enables promods mode, doesn't do much but change images
* --logetcarsdata : prints in console every ETCARS data received
* --logallactivity : prints in console every activity sent to Discord
* --clientConfiguration : specify clientconfiguration.json path
