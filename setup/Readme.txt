Thank you for installing Virtual Trucker Rich Presence!
VT-RPC is an easy tool to let others see your current job, truck, etc. using Discord Rich Presence!  

Here's our Discord server for support: https://discord.gg/Zt49WDH  
ETCARS 0.15.386 is required for the RPC to work, older versions will not work.  

Things to note
==============================
* TruckersMP has their own Rich Presence which needs to be disabled in MP Settings!
* Due to a few problems with previous ETCARS, you will need to install ETCARS 0.15.386 from our installer.
* IF YOU HAVE ETCARS older than 0.15.386 INSTALLED, PLEASE REINSTALL IT WITH ONE INCLUDED WITH VT-RPC!
